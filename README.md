# Unifi-Video-Tools

I have no affilieation with Ubiquiti Networks, just really like their tech and wanted to add a few features to my work environment. 

Adds an "Expand" button to the "live-view" page of the unifi video site. This is because on ultra wide monitor I want it to use the full height but still be able to use other apps on the side. 

Eventually I'd like it to auto sign in and navigate to the live view page for my security station in our office.
